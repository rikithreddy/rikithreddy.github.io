Humans being social animals need to build stronger social bonds for survival and hence need to be connected. We started developing sophisticated technology to serve this purpose. However, it's important we understand if these technologies made us ‘too connected’, and started affecting their purpose of building social bonds?  

Yes,  We are in an era where we are too connected which is leading to gradual diminish in human social skills. The primary purpose for developing technology for connectivity was to provide an effective way to communicate and exchange information. Human race came a long way from using pigeons to the Internet for communication, reducing the time required from days to milliseconds. In a holistic sense, we are truly connected. However, when we have a closer examination we can see, that gradually our social bonds are getting weaker due to the same technology that was meant for connecting people. A really great example would be the enormous amounts of irrelevant information we receive on our social media platforms. As we are able to send huge amounts of information within milliseconds the rate at which data started pumping at an average human increase exponentially. Humans have limited capabilities for information processing and storage and hence generally discard lots of information in day-day life, However, in this case, discarding irrelevant information is not so trivial and hence we eventually start ignoring all information pumped at us. Proving this is not really difficult just have a look at the number of unread emails and WhatsApp conversation you have, Just think how many times you put your phone is silent. Another good example would be our knowledge bases and information sharing platforms. Information sharing platforms such as Youtube also come loaded with huge amounts of entertainment content. With the availability of large amounts of entertainment content which can glue people to their seats for hours drastically reduces the number of social interactions one has. Even toddlers ignoring their mother has become a common sight these days when such source of entertainment is available. One could always imagine the possible implications of such behaviour in future. Human society is on its way to becoming socially disoriented.

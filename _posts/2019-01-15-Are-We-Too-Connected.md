Being social animals, humans need to build strong bonds for survival to stay connected. We began started developing sophisticated technology to serve this purpose. However, it's important that we question whether these technologies make us ‘too connected’ and have started defeating their purpose?

We are in an era where we are too connected. This is gradually diminishing human social skills. The human race has come a long way from pigeons to the Internet reducing the time required for communication from days to milliseconds. In a holistic sense, we are truly connected. Ironically, the same technologies are weakening our social bonds. A really great example would be the enormous amounts of irrelevant information we receive on our social media platforms. That is the byproduct of being able to send huge amounts of information within milliseconds, which in turn increased data being pumped at a average human exponentially.

Humans have limited capabilities for information processing and storage. We are not well equipped to process the humongous amounts of information being thrown at us. Hence, we resort to discard most of the information that we obtain by these highly advanced communication devices. Proving this is not really difficult, just look at the number of unread Emails and WhatsApp conversation you have, Just remember how many times you wanted to put your phone on silent and stay away from everyone. Another good example would be our knowledge bases and information sharing platforms. Information sharing platforms such as Youtube also come loaded with huge amounts of entertainment content. With the availability of large amounts of entertainment content which can glue people to their seats for hours. Resulting in a drastic reduction in the number of social interactions one has. Toddlers ignoring their mother has become a common sight these days when such source of entertainment is available. You can always speculate how social the future generations would be.
These are some early indicators that we have become ‘too connected’. Being connected was good for human society but we have overdone it. We need to remember too much of good is bad.

Never occurred; that I could,
Fear that engulfed, for I'd be alone forever,
Oh! the thoughts I'd never find someone so good,
Now I know all that; ain't really clever,

Broken hearts n' never ending fight,
Eternal silences; Things that can't be undone,
Never occurred; that I had the might,
Ain't simpler said than done,

Yet I'm here; Writing it down,
Dozen o'book; million o'song; all that it took
To lay here alone at dawn,

Another regret? Oh! never has it come,
Gone is her beauty; with her my 13 pounds,
Endless tears? Oh! never have they come,
Few dates n' life did come around,

All it took? Two sweet hearts another side of the world,
Few book avalanches n' unexpected dates; everything did come,
oh! here I'm serene, with contentment I earned,
N' I know there's more to come, Coz I ain't sitting here all frowned.

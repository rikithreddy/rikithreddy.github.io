<p align="center">
Never occurred; I could,  
Fear that engulfed, for I'd be alone forever,  
Oh! the thoughts; I'd never find someone so good,  
Now I know all that ain't really clever,  

Broken hearts; never ending fight,  
Eternal silences; Things that can't be undone,  
Never occurred; I had the might,  
Well all ain't simpler said than done,  

Yet here I'm; Writing this down,  
Dozen o'book; million o'song; all that it took  
To lay here alone at dawn,  

Another regret? Oh! never has it come,  
Gone is her beauty; with her my thirteen pounds,  
Endless tears? Oh! never have they come,  
Few dates n' life did come around,  

All it took? Two sweethearts; far side of the world,  
Few book avalanches n' unexpected dates; everything did come,  
Oh! here I'm serene, with contentment I earned,  
N' I know there's more to come, Coz I ain't sitting here all frowned.

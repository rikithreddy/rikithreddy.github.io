<p align="center">
Never occurred; I could,<br>
Fear that engulfed, for I'd be alone forever,<br>
Oh! the thoughts; I'd never find someone so good,<br>
Now I know all that ain't really clever,<br>
<br>
Broken hearts; never ending fight,<br>
Eternal silences; Things that can't be undone,<br>
Never occurred; I had the might,<br>
Well all ain't simpler said than done,<br>
<br>
Yet here I'm; Writing this down,<br>
Dozen o'book; million o'song; all that it took<br>
To lay here alone at dawn,<br>
<br>
Another regret? Oh! never has it come,<br>
Gone is her beauty; with her my thirteen pounds,<br>
Endless tears? Oh! never have they come,<br>
Few dates n' life did come around,<br>
<br>
All it took? Two sweethearts; far side of the world,<br>
Few book avalanches n' unexpected dates; everything did come,<br>
Oh! here I'm serene, with contentment I earned,<br>
N' I know there's more to come, Coz I ain't sitting here all frowned.<br>

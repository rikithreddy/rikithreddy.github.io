Five word challenge

still, time, aesthetic, start, carpet
"The red carpet, like an aesthetic painting left me speechless. Its beauty made time stand still. Well, atleast until the gunfire started yet again."


death, coffee, abrupt, random, play
Death played her violin, as I fell down abruptly. The shattering of my coffee cup, the random gun fire. Everything: seemed so well orchestrated.

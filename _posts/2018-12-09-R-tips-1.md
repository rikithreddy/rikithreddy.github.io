This blog post is the first of a series of blog I would be writing. This series would be covering various tips and tricks for using R language efficently. This post would cover a really simple tip to deal with multivalued fields. Multivalued fields are fields in a data record which hold multiple values of the same.
attribute.

Below is an example of a similar situation I delt with while working with the [goodreads 10k dataset](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k). The dataset is a csv file containing information of various books. I was intrested in finding all unique authors that dataset had, However the books seemed to have multiple authors. For example *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* had two authors *J.K. Rowling* and *Mary GrandPré*. 

``` r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv('../data/books.csv')
temp <- df %>% 
        select(original_title,authors)
head(temp)
```




| **SlNo**  |                       **original_title** |                     **authors** |
| 1 |                         The Hunger Games  |            Suzanne Collins |
| 2 | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone | J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré |
| 3 |                                Twilight  |           Stephenie Meyer |
| 4 |                    To Kill a Mockingbird |                 Harper Lee |
| 5 |                        The Great Gatsby  |       F. Scott Fitzgerald |
| 6 |                  The Fault in Our Stars  |                John Green |




Clearly the first task was to convert the multivalued field to a single valued field then find unique values of thoes single valued fields. In R we can perform the task by using the function `separate_rows()`, the function when given a multivalued column in a dataframe seperates and converts all the multivalued attributes to multiple single valued attributes. Below is an illustration for the dataset.

``` r
temp <- separate_rows(df,authors,sep = ',') 
head(temp %>% select(original_title,authors))
```

| **SlNo**  |                       **original_title** |                     **authors** |
| 1          |               The Hunger Games  |   Suzanne Collins |
| 2 | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone |       J.K. Rowling |
| 3 | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone |     Mary GrandPré |
| 4 |                                Twilight  |   Stephenie Meyer |
| 5 |                   To Kill a Mockingbird  |        Harper Lee |
| 6 |                        The Great Gatsby | F. Scott Fitzgerald |

Now that the multivalued field have been converted into single valued field we can apply the `unique()` function in R to find all the unique values for a vector. 
``` r
unique_authors <- unique(temp$authors)
unique_authors[2]
```

Output | [1] "J.K. Rowling" |


Now that we have a list of unique authors we can perform other tasks like finding all books the author wrote. 
``` r
df %>% 
  filter(grepl(unique_authors[2], authors)) %>%
  select(authors,original_title) %>% head()
```

| **SlNo** |                                   authors | **original_title** |
| 1 |             J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone |
| 2 | J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré, Rufus Beck | Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban |
| 3  |            J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré | Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix |
| 4   |           J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré | Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets |
| 5    |          J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré | Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire |
| 6     |         J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré | Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows |

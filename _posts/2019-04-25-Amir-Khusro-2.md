Well this is my second attempt at the The Amir Khusro Challenge. In case you did not read my first blog about the challenge click here. I wanted a harder challenge this time, so I increased the number of random words from five to seven. Well it was really difficult to come up with something which had meaning at first from the random set of words. Well Game of Thrones came to my rescue. As no one knows the ending as of now, I wrote my own.


## Random Word
`return, green, secure, narrow, stand-up, shield, glass`

## Challenge-2
```
The night king had truly returned. He brought the brutal winter and painted the once green lands of Westeros with exotic red and white. A Lord; A Lady; A King; The Iron Throne; nothing mattered now.  The thoughts flowed like a river through her, as she lay in her secure chamber across the narrow hallway. There was nothing to stand up against what was coming. Her shield, The mountain, once a terrifying monster, was now nothing more than a glass wall.
```

P.S: Season-8 episode 2 was the last episode aired before the post was written. (I case I ended up predicting something :p)

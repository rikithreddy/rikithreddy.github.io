<meta name="description" content="Python has many cool features. One of them is tuple assignment. This can be used to assign multiple variables in a single line. Not only making code more readable but also simple. The assignment follows simple mechanics where variables on LHS are assigned corresponding elements on RHS. One should also remember that the number of elements on LHS must be equal to RHS as the assignment is element-wise. Examples: Swapping Numbers A typical code for swapping two numbers would look something as shown below. It required creating a temporary variable and destroying it later. This is some tedious work. temp = a a = b b = temp remove(temp) The same thing can be achieved in python in a single line. a,b = b,a This makes the code lot more readable and easy to understand but also beautiful and simple. GCD of two numbers Swapping numbers is a simple task. Consider code for Calculating GCD (using euclidean algorithm). def get_gcd(a,b) while(b!=0): a,b = b, a%b return b Really cool isn’t it? Unpacking from tuple data-structure You can also perform assignment as follows name =(surya, prakash, rao) first_name,last_name,middle_name = name Assign slices in a list We can go further and assign indivisual slices of a list as follows. x = [1,2,3] y = [3,5,6] x[0:2] = y[0:2] # now x =[3,5,3] But be careful when your LHS size is not equal to RHS, it can lead to addition of an extra number which may not be intended. Its important to keep a note of this. x =[1,2,3] y = [3,5,6] x[0:1] =y[0:2] # now x = [3,5,2,3] Common mistakes While the feature is really helpful, people tend to make some common mistakes. One of them is shown below. Where size on both sides is not equal so python is not able to unpack. temp = (1,2,3) a,b = temp Output: Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2) Always remember that you need to have equal number of elements on LHS and RHS to assign properly to avoid this mistake. Zen of Python Always remember Zen of Python: Beautiful is better than ugly Simple is better than complex Readability counts If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea." />

    <p>Python has many cool features. One of them is tuple assignment. This can be used to assign multiple variables in a single line. Not only making code more readable but also simple. The assignment follows simple mechanics where variables on LHS are assigned corresponding elements on RHS. One should also remember that the number of elements on LHS must be equal to RHS as the assignment is element-wise.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples:</h2>

<h3 id="swapping-numbers">Swapping Numbers</h3>

<p>A typical code for swapping two numbers would look something as shown below. It required creating a temporary variable and destroying it later. This is some tedious work.</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">temp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span> 
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">temp</span> 
<span class="n">remove</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">temp</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same thing can be achieved in python in a single line.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">a</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This makes the code lot more readable and easy to understand but also beautiful and simple.</p>

<h3 id="gcd-of-two-numbers">GCD of two numbers</h3>
<p>Swapping numbers is a simple task. Consider code for Calculating GCD (using euclidean algorithm).</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_gcd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">while</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">!=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
		<span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">b</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Really cool isn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="unpacking-from-tuple-data-structure">Unpacking from tuple data-structure</h3>

<p>You can also perform assignment as follows</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">surya</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">prakash</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rao</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">first_name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">middle_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="assign-slices-in-a-list">Assign slices in a list</h3>

<p>We can go further and assign indivisual slices of a list as follows.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c"># now x =[3,5,3]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But be careful when your LHS size is not equal to RHS, it can lead to addition of an extra number which may not be intended. Its important to keep a note of this.</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c"># now x = [3,5,2,3]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h2>

<p>While the feature is really helpful, people tend to make some common mistakes. One of them is shown below. Where size on both sides is not equal so python is not able to unpack.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">temp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">temp</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-output">Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Always remember that you need to have equal number of elements on LHS and RHS to assign properly to avoid this mistake.</p>

<h2 id="zen-of-python">Zen of Python</h2>

<p>Always remember <em>Zen of Python</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
  <li>Simple is better than complex</li>
  <li>Readability counts</li>
  <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
</ul>

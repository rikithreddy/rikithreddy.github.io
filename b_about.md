Hey! I am Rikith Reddy, an undergraduate student from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, in Computer Science, a Machine Learning, and AI enthusiast. 
    The idea of synthetic intelligence has always been fascinating to me. As this explores the most complex part of a human being, the "Brain" which essentially differentiates a human being from various other life forms. Artificial intelligence is one such area, dealing with synthesizing human intelligence and automating it for various purposes. Machine Learning is an area in Artificial intelligence, which deals with studying how a machine can exhibit the same behaviour as a human ie, learning and improving itself from its experiences, without the need for explicitly programming. This blog looks into both AI and Machine learning, covering a wide range of topics such as the theory, the tools available for implementation and also the current ongoing research in these areas.
